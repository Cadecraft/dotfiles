# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles: how I store my preferences for various tools.

I don't have much here for now, but I'll update this repository in the future.

## Organization

- Folders represent each application/category
- Filenames are versioned, due to legacy reasons with my old version control system (sorry it looks like that :sob:)

## Current Dotfiles

- Configs for Vim, gVim, and Neovim
- Config for tmux
- Config for Zsh
