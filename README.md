# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles: how I store my preferences and configs for various tools.

## Organization

- Folders represent each application/category, if there are lots of files or if the filenames alone do not make it clear what application they are for
- Otherwise, filenames should be self-explanatory; all files are listed below.

## Notes

- Several of these dotfiles are intended to be used with nerd/powerline fonts. My go-to font is Consolas7NF [Znuff/consolas-powerline](https://github.com/Znuff/consolas-powerline).

## Current Dotfiles

- Configs for Vim, gVim, and Neovim
    - Create the tmp folder for swapfiles under `HOME/vimfiles/tmp`
    - Also includes minimal portable Vim config
- Config for lf terminal file manager (lfrc and icons)
- Config for tmux
- Config for Zsh
- Config for Alacritty
- Config for komorebi tiling window manager
- Config for PowerShell (put under `HOME/Documents/WindowsPowerShell`)
